=head1 NAME

inc::Beer::Admin - Alcoholic Replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.02 of inc::Beer::Admin, released
February 28, 2003.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your Makefile.PL:

    use inc::Beer::Admin;
    WriteMakefile;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a drop-in replacement for B<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>,
and a fork of the wonderfully inspiring B<CPAN::MakeMaker>.

The intention of this module is to encourage adoption for the
catalyst-style, customizable distribution pioneered by Brian "Ingy"
Ingerson's B<CPAN::MakeMaker>.

End-users of such distributions do not have to download or install
C<inc::Beer::Admin> at all -- the neccessary parts are automatically
bundled with distributions generated by B<Makefile.PL>; F<MANIFEST>
is also updated automatically..

Before I get around to write some new documentations for this module,
please just read L<CPAN::MakeMaker> and L<CPAN::MakeMaker-Philosophy>
for the real documentation. :-)

Based on version 0.10 of B<CPAN::MakeMaker>, this module adds several
features:

=over 4

=item Checking and installing F<nmake.exe> on Win32

For Win32 Perl users, the non-redistributable F<nmake.exe> is often 
needed before installing CPAN modules.  Now simply write this in
your F<Makefile.PL>:

    use inc::Beer::Admin 'check_nmake';
    check_nmake();
    WriteMakefile;

It will then automatically check for a valid F<nmake.exe> before
writing F<Makefile.PL>, and offers to download it from the vendor
site and install it.

=item Fetching remote files via FTP

You may also import C<get_file> function to fetch needed files,
executables, B<PAR> bundles, etc from remote hosts.

=item Integration with B<Module::Signature>

A new make action, B<make distsign>, is added for B<Module::Signature>
users to sign the distribution before release.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why does this module have an C<inc> prefix?

The original implementation of B<CPAN::MakeMaker> introduces subtle
problems for distributions ending with C<CPAN> (e.g. B<CPAN.pm>,
B<WAIT::Format::CPAN>), because its placement in F<./CPAN/> duplicates
the real libraries that will get installed; also, the directory name
F<./CPAN/> may confuse users.

On the other hand, putting bundled, for-build-time-only libraries in
F<./inc/> is a normal practice, and there is little chance that a
CPAN distribution will be called C<Something::inc>, so it's much safer
to use.

Also, it allows for other helper modules like B<ExtUtils::AutoInstall>
to reside also in F<./inc/>, and to make use of them in the future.

=head2 But what about the C<Beer::Admin> part?

On February 28, 2003, the following exchange took place on MagNet
C<#perl>:

    <ingy> autrijus: I might just advise that only CPAN.pm use 0.11,
           and not actually release the version for the general public
    <autrijus> ugh. but i want 0.11 to play with :)
    <Spoon> 0.11 of what?
    <autrijus> Spoon: of a highly convoluted module that requires
               Int 17 to understand.
    <Spoon> it has no name?
    <autrijus> no one dare speaking of its name.
    <autrijus> Spoon: but one can hint; it has the nexus of perl
               community as its first name, and the humble device that
               installs modules as its last name
    <EuroXwrn> Beer::Admin
    <Spoon> oh. that one.
    <autrijus> EuroXwrn: that's a good one
    <Spoon> ingy's module that someone called viral
    <ingy> Spoon: shhhh
    * autrijus decides to fork CPAN::MakeMaker into Acme::Beer::Admin
    <ingy> nice

So there.  It's all Schwern's fault.
