This is the README file for inc::Beer::Admin, an alcoholic replacement
for ExtUtils::MakeMaker and a fork of CPAN::MakeMaker.

Please type "perldoc inc::Beer::Admin" after installation to see the
module usage information.

* Installation

inc::Beer::Admin uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v             # see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

* Notes for Windows users

If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will probably need the 'nmake'
utility before installation. It's available at:

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

If you are connected to the internet, "perl Makefile.PL" is capable
of automatically fetch it, and install into your windows directory;
all you have to do is to answer 'y' to this question:

    Required executable 'nmake' not found. Install it? [Y/n]:

However, if you are not yet online, or wish to install 'nmake' into
another directory, then please download the file manually, save it to
a directory in %PATH (e.g. C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND), then launch the MS-DOS
command line shell, "cd" to that directory, and run "nmake15.exe" from
there; that will create the 'nmake.exe' file needed by CPANPLUS.

You may then resume the installation process above, but replace 'make'
with 'nmake' in the last three lines.
